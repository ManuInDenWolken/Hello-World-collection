# The "Hello World!" collection

### What's that f*cking shit?
I was bored and so I collected some programming languages' "Hello World!"'s. 

<br/>

### What should I do with this collection?
Nothing. If you're bored too, you're welcome to contribute to this repository.

<br/>

### Current state
This project will be WIP forever. New programming languages - esoteric or not - are published every year; so this
collection will never end.

<br/>

### Contribute
If you want to contribute to this repository, fork it. The scheme for the commit messages is following:
`Added common/complex xyz`
Example: `Added common rust`

<br/>

PS: I like stars, so please star the repo :rofl:
